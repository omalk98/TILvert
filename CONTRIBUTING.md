## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Check if the issue already exists: Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to see if someone else has already reported the same problem or requested the same feature.

2. Create a new issue: If your issue does not already exist, provide a clear and descriptive title and describe the bug or feature request in detail. **Be sure to mention the steps to reproduce the bug if applicable**.

3. Follow up with a Pull Request: If you would like to fix the bug or implement the feature yourself, please open an issue first to discuss your changes. Once the issue is approved, you can follow up with a pull request.

4. If the bug fix or feature request is simple enough to be addressed without discussion, you can directly open a pull request as long as adequate information is provided in the pull request description.

### Code Review and Approval:

Your pull request will be reviewed and if all checks pass, it will be approved. If there are any issues, we can discuss them in the pull request and come to a solution.

### Merge:

Once your pull request is approved and passes all checks, it will be merged into the `master` branch.
